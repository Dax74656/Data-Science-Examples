IF(Column>Days, "Late", "On Time")	Checks a condition and returns one of two values.
DAYS(Columns Date 2, Column Date 1)	Calculates the difference in days between two dates.
SUMIF(Column1:Column2, "W001", Column3:Column4)	Sums values based on a condition.
AVERAGE(Firstrow:Lastrow)	Calculates the mean of a range.
FORECAST.LINEAR(6, Firstrow:Lastrow, Firstrow:Lastrow2ndColumn)	Predicts a future value using linear regression.
=COUNTIF(A:A, "W001")	Counts how many times "W001" appears in column A.
=VLOOKUP(1001, A2:C100, 2, FALSE)	Searches for 1001 in column A and returns the corresponding value from column 2. FALSE ensures an exact match.
=HLOOKUP(6, A1:G2, 2, FALSE)	Looks for 6 in row 1 and returns the corresponding value from row 2.
=INDEX(B2:B100, MATCH(1001, A2:A100, 0))	Finds 1001 in column A and returns the corresponding value from column B. More flexible and faster than VLOOKUP.
=TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, A2:A5)	Joins values in A2:A5 with commas (, ) between them. Example Output: "Warehouse A, Warehouse B, Warehouse C"
=CONCAT(A2, " - ", B2)	Combines text from A2 and B2 with " - " in between.
